# QLoRA + DPO fine-tuning on Llama-3-8B with Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset.

## Technical Report: Large Language Model Alignment Study

---

## Executive Summary

This study investigates the effectiveness of two prominent parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques—**QLoRA** (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) and **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization)—for aligning the Llama-3-8B base model with human preferences using the Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset. The research evaluates model performance across three critical dimensions: toxicity reduction, helpfulness enhancement, and harmlessness preservation.

**Key Findings:**
- **QLoRA** achieved the most significant toxicity reduction (-44.3%) while maintaining helpfulness
- **DPO** showed moderate toxicity reduction (-30.9%) but experienced some helpfulness trade-off
- **Training disparities significantly influenced results** - QLoRA received 2× epochs and 2× data compared to DPO
- Both methods successfully improved model safety without catastrophic forgetting
- **Resource constraints** (GPU memory, training time) impacted DPO's training configuration and potentially limited its performance

## Methodology

### Dataset
- **Training Data**: Anthropic HH-RLHF dataset (10,000 samples for QLoRA, 5,000 for DPO)
- **Evaluation Data**: Curated subset of 100 challenging prompts covering safety-critical scenarios
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Toxicity**: Automated scoring using Detoxify BERT model
  - **Helpfulness**: 5-point Likert scale via GPT-4o-mini judge
  - **Harmlessness**: 5-point Likert scale via GPT-4o-mini judge

### Model Architecture

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Base Model** | Meta Llama-3-8B (8B parameters) |
| **QLoRA Config** | r=16, α=32, 4-bit quantization |
| **DPO Config** | β=0.1, sigmoid loss, reference model |
| **Hardware** | NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU |

## Technical Implementation

### Two-Stage Alignment Pipeline

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with QLoRA**
   - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning using 4-bit quantization
   - LoRA rank 16 with alpha 32 for optimal parameter utilization
   - 2 epochs with optimized learning rate scheduling

2. **Preference Optimization with DPO**
   - Direct optimization on preference pairs from HH-RLHF
   - Reference model preservation for stability
   - Single epoch with conservative learning rate (5e-7)

### Evaluation Framework

The evaluation system employs a multi-metric approach:

```python
# Automated toxicity assessment
toxicity_score = detoxify_bert(response)

# Human-aligned quality metrics via LLM judge
helpfulness_score = gpt4o_judge(prompt, response, "helpfulness")
harmlessness_score = gpt4o_judge(prompt, response, "harmlessness")
```

## Technical Insights

### QLoRA Effectiveness
The quantized low-rank adaptation proved highly effective for safety alignment:
- **Memory Efficiency**: 4-bit quantization reduced memory footprint by ~75%
- **Training Stability**: Gradient accumulation and warmup prevented optimization issues
- **Parameter Efficiency**: Only 0.1% of parameters modified (LoRA rank 16)

### DPO Characteristics
Direct preference optimization revealed interesting behavioral patterns:
- **Conservative Alignment**: Lower learning rate prevented overfitting but limited gains
- **Reference Model Dependency**: Performance tied to SFT quality
- **Preference Sensitivity**: More responsive to nuanced preference signals

### Comparative Analysis

#### Training Configuration Disparity

**Critical Training Differences:**
- **QLoRA (SFT)**: 2 epochs, 10,000 samples, LR=2.0e-4, effective batch size=16
- **DPO**: 1 epoch, 5,000 samples, LR=5.0e-7, effective batch size=16

*Note: QLoRA received significantly more training exposure (2× epochs, 2× data) compared to DPO due to GPU memory constraints and training time limitations. This disparity likely contributed to QLoRA's superior performance.*

**QLoRA Advantages:**
- Superior toxicity reduction without helpfulness loss
- More extensive training (2 epochs vs DPO's 1 epoch)
- Higher learning rate enabling faster convergence (2.0e-4 vs 5.0e-7)
- Larger dataset exposure (10,000 vs 5,000 samples)
- More stable optimization landscape with gradient accumulation

**DPO Limitations (Current Setup):**
- Conservative learning rate (5.0e-7) limited adaptation speed
- Reduced training data (50% of QLoRA) due to memory constraints
- Single epoch training insufficient for full preference learning
- Reference model dependency amplified training sensitivity

**Technical Configuration Details:**

From `configs/training_config.yaml`:
```yaml
# QLoRA Training Hyperparameters
num_train_epochs: 2
per_device_train_batch_size: 2
gradient_accumulation_steps: 8  # Effective batch size: 16
learning_rate: 2.0e-4
num_train_samples: 10000
```

From `configs/dpo_config.yaml`:
```yaml
# DPO Training Hyperparameters
num_train_epochs: 1
per_device_train_batch_size: 1
gradient_accumulation_steps: 16  # Effective batch size: 16
learning_rate: 5.0e-7
num_train_samples: 5000
beta: 0.1
loss_type: "sigmoid"
```

**Methodological Considerations:**
Given equivalent computational budgets, DPO might demonstrate different performance characteristics with:
- Extended training epochs (2-3 epochs)
- Larger preference datasets (10,000+ pairs)
- Optimized learning rate scheduling
- Multi-stage DPO training pipeline

## Inference Optimization & Performance

### Implemented Optimizations

The evaluation pipeline includes several inference optimizations for efficient deployment:

#### 1. 4-bit Quantization
```python
quant_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",           # 4-bit NormalFloat quantization
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16 # Mixed precision for speed
)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    base_model_name,
    quantization_config=quant_config,     # 4-bit quantization enabled
    device_map="auto",                   # Automatic device placement
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16           # Memory efficient dtype
)
```

#### 2. Adapter Merging for Faster Inference
```python
# Load adapter if provided
if model_path:
    model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, model_path)
    print("Merging adapter for faster inference...")
    model = model.merge_and_unload()  # Merging for speed optimization
```

#### 3. Memory & Speed Optimizations
- **Device Mapping**: `device_map="auto"` for optimal GPU placement across available devices

- **Efficient Generation**: Proper `pad_token_id` and `max_new_tokens` settings for optimal token generation

#### Performance Benefits
- **Memory Reduction**: ~75% memory savings with 4-bit quantization
